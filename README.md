# Mouth Open Checker
Smart India Hackathon 2020:

Uses realtime webcam feed data to measure attentiveness of a user in online classes by checking for yawning and talking, ie, measuring how much the mouth opens and closes.

Uses dlib facial recognition, Python and basic OpenCV to plot the 68 facial landmarks and develop functions to measure the extent of the user's mouth opening or closing, giving us a boolean value based on a set threshold.
